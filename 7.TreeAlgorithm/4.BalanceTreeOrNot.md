## **Balanced Binary Tree**

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

-----

### 1\. Problem Understanding

We are given:

  * A pointer to the `root` of a binary tree.

We need to determine:

  * If the tree is **height-balanced**.

**Definition:**
A binary tree is **height-balanced** if, for **every single node** in the tree, the absolute difference between the heights of its left subtree and its right subtree is **at most 1**.

  * An empty tree is considered height-balanced.
  * A tree with a single node is considered height-balanced.

-----

### 2\. Recursive Intuition

The problem has a natural recursive definition. A node `root` is balanced **IF AND ONLY IF**:

1.  Its **left subtree** is balanced.
2.  Its **right subtree** is balanced.
3.  The heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1 (i.e., `abs(height(root->left) - height(root->right)) <= 1`).

This leads to a recursive solution. The key difference between the naive and optimal approaches is *how* we compute and pass this information.

-----

### 3\. Approach 1: Naive (Top-Down) O(N²)

This approach directly translates the recursive definition.

  * **`isBalanced(root)` function:**
    1.  **Base Case:** If `root` is `NULL`, return `true` (an empty tree is balanced).
    2.  **Check Current Node:**
          * Calculate the height of the *entire* left subtree (using a separate `height()` function).
          * Calculate the height of the *entire* right subtree (using `height()`).
          * If `abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1`, return `false`.
    3.  **Check Children:**
          * Recursively call `isBalanced(root->left)`.
          * Recursively call `isBalanced(root->right)`.
          * Return `true` only if *both* children are balanced.

#### Why is this O(N²)?

  * The `isBalanced` function visits every node (N nodes).
  * For **each node**, it calls the `height()` function.
  * The `height()` function *also* visits all descendants of that node.
  * In the worst case (a skewed tree, like a linked list), `height()` for the root takes O(N), for its child O(N-1), and so on.
  * This results in a time complexity of `T(N) = T(N-1) + O(N)`, which is **O(N²)**. We are re-calculating the heights of the lower nodes many, many times.

-----

### 4\. Approach 2: Optimal (Bottom-Up) O(N)

This approach is much more efficient because it combines the height calculation and the balance check into a single recursive function (a post-order traversal).

  * **Idea:** Instead of just returning the height, the function will return:

      * The **height** of the node, *if* it's balanced.
      * A special **"error" value** (like `-1`), *if* it's unbalanced.

  * **`depth(root)` helper function:**

    1.  **Base Case:** If `root` is `NULL`, return `0` (height is 0, and it's balanced).
    2.  **Recursive Calls:**
          * `lh = depth(root->left)`
          * `rh = depth(root->right)`
    3.  **Check for Unbalance (Propagation):**
          * If `lh == -1` or `rh == -1` (meaning a child subtree was *already* found to be unbalanced), propagate this error up. Return `-1`.
    4.  **Check for Unbalance (Current Node):**
          * If `abs(lh - rh) > 1`, this current node is unbalanced. Return `-1`.
    5.  **If Balanced:**
          * If the node is balanced, return its actual height: `1 + max(lh, rh)`.

  * The main `isBalanced` function simply calls `depth(root)` and checks if the result is `-1`.

#### Why is this O(N)?

  * This is a single post-order traversal.
  * Each node in the tree is visited **exactly once**.
  * At each node, we do a constant amount of work (two comparisons and one `max` operation).
  * This gives a total time complexity of **O(N)**.

-----

### 5\. Space Complexity (Both Approaches)

  * Both solutions use recursion. The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the **recursion call stack**.
  * This is equal to the height of the tree, **O(H)**.
      * **Best Case (Balanced Tree):** O(log N)
      * **Worst Case (Skewed Tree):** O(N)

-----

### 6\. Code (Both Approaches)

#### Approach 1: Naive O(N²) Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 * int val;
 * TreeNode *left;
 * TreeNode *right;
 * TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 * TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 * TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

// Time Complexity: O(N*N)
// Space Complexity: O(H) (due to recursion stack)

class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to find height (O(N) on its own)
    int height(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;
        return 1 + max(height(root->left), height(root->right));
    }

    // Main function to check balance
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        // Base case: An empty tree is balanced
        if (root == nullptr) return true;

        // 1. Check balance at the current node
        // (This height calculation is O(N) for the root)
        int leftHeight = height(root->left);
        int rightHeight = height(root->right);

        if (abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1)
            return false;

        // 2. Check if left and right subtrees are *also* balanced
        // (This makes the function O(N^2) due to re-computation)
        return isBalanced(root->left) && isBalanced(root->right);
    }
};
```

#### Approach 2: Optimal O(N) Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 * int val;
 * TreeNode *left;
 * TreeNode *right;
 * TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 * TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 * TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

// Time Complexity: O(N)
// Space Complexity: O(H) (due to recursion stack)

class SolutionOptimal {
public:
    // Helper function that returns height if balanced, or -1 if unbalanced
    int depth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;

        // Recursively find depth of left and right subtrees (post-order)
        int lh = depth(root->left);
        int rh = depth(root->right);

        // If a subtree is unbalanced (lh == -1 or rh == -1) OR
        // if the current node is unbalanced (abs(lh - rh) > 1),
        // then propagate -1 (unbalanced) up.
        if (lh == -1 || rh == -1 || abs(lh - rh) > 1) 
            return -1;

        // Otherwise, return the actual height
        return 1 + max(lh, rh);
    }

    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        // The tree is balanced if the helper function does NOT return -1
        return depth(root) != -1;
    }
};
```

### 7\. Dry Run (Optimal O(N) Approach)

**Input Tree:**

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
     /  \
    15   7
```

1.  `isBalanced(3)` calls `depth(3)`
2.  `depth(3)` calls `depth(9)`
      * `depth(9)` calls `depth(NULL)` (left) -\> returns `0`
      * `depth(9)` calls `depth(NULL)` (right) -\> returns `0`
      * `abs(0 - 0) <= 1`. Returns `1 + max(0, 0)` -\> `1`
3.  `depth(3)` calls `depth(20)`
      * `depth(20)` calls `depth(15)`
          * `depth(15)` calls `depth(NULL)` (left) -\> returns `0`
          * `depth(15)` calls `depth(NULL)` (right) -\> returns `0`
          * `abs(0 - 0) <= 1`. Returns `1 + max(0, 0)` -\> `1`
      * `depth(20)` calls `depth(7)`
          * `depth(7)` calls `depth(NULL)` (left) -\> returns `0`
          * `depth(7)` calls `depth(NULL)` (right) -\> returns `0`
          * `abs(0 - 0) <= 1`. Returns `1 + max(0, 0)` -\> `1`
      * `lh = 1`, `rh = 1`. `abs(1 - 1) <= 1`. Returns `1 + max(1, 1)` -\> `2`
4.  `depth(3)` has `lh = 1` (from 9) and `rh = 2` (from 20).
      * `abs(1 - 2) <= 1`. Returns `1 + max(1, 2)` -\> `3`
5.  `isBalanced(3)` gets `3`. Since `3 != -1`, it returns `true`.

 **Key Takeaways:**

  * A "Top-Down" recursive solution that re-computes information (like `height`) at each node often leads to **O(N²)** complexity.
  * A "Bottom-Up" (post-order) solution that computes and passes information (like height *and* balance status) up the tree can achieve **O(N)**.
  * Using special return values (like `-1`) is a common pattern in tree recursion to "fail-fast" or propagate an error/unbalanced state.
